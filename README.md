# About Me

I am an Industrial Designer from Brisbane with a passion for problem-solving, innovation, and continuous improvement. 

I enjoy work that allows me to use creative thinking to innovate and create new ideas and solutions to hard problems. 

I am interested in developing ideas, making objects and developing innovative processes. 

I have lived in Brisbane since 2012. I moved to Brisbane from a rural town in QLD to study Industrial Design at QUT graduating with a Bachelor of Industrial Design (Honours) with a minor in Graphic Design.

I offer Industrial Design services for a select number of word-of-mouth clients and also run a design studio, [Studio Blackthorn](http://www.studioblackthorn.com.au). 

With a focus on arts, industrial design, furniture design, and design for manufacturing, I actively collaborate with workshops, creative studios, and art practices to explore new methods and mediums. I am currently engaged in exploring the unique possibilities of 3D printing for producing finished pieces. 

In the big picture, I like to pay attention to how things come together and how they look and interact within a space.
